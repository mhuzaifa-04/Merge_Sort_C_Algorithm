# 📘 Merge Sort Menu-Driven Program in C

## 📌 Overview
This program demonstrates **Merge Sort** in C using a **menu-driven approach**.  
Merge Sort is a **divide and conquer algorithm** that divides an array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm (Merge Sort)
1. Divide the array into two halves.  
2. Recursively sort both halves.  
3. Merge the sorted halves into one sorted array.  

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)  
- Average Case: O(n log n)  
- Worst Case: O(n log n)  

### Space Complexity:
- O(n) (extra space for merging).
